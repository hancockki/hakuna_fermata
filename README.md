# Post Rock for a Post-Normal World
My project takes on the task of sampling from different pieces of post rock music. What is "post rock"?, you might ask. This is an excellent question since post rock is a rather unheard of musical genre.
## What *is* post rock??
Post rock emerged in the late 20th century within the indie and underground music scene. The genre is quite experimental, defying conventional song structure and often using a wide range of musical elements such as synths, melodic melodies, and crazy drum beats. Simon Reynolds coined the term, using it to describe music which "uses rock instrumentation for non-rock purposes, using guitars as facilitators of timbre and textures rather than riffs and power chords" [read more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-rock#:~:text=Post%2Drock%20is%20a%20form,combining%20rock%20instrumentation%20with%20electronics.). Typically, post-rock pieces are lengthy, between 12-30 minutes in length, and take the listener on a journey through the space the song creates. 
Popular post rock bands include:
1. *Talk Talk*
2. *Slint*
3. *Bark Psychosis*
4. *Swans*
5. *Godspeed You! Black Emperor*
6. *Stars of the Lid*
